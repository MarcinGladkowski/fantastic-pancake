As you see my name is Marcin. I coding a past few years and i am sure it's my passion.
I trying to learn something new everyday. I always wondering about writing my own blog. 
There is a way to memorize somethings about what i learn but also what i am done and each
activity in programming. I am very opened mind to new things. If you read this little description 
and maybe you want code something new, it's time to write to me.

Best regards,

Marcin
