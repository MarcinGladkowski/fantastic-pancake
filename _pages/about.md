Hello everyone! I coding a past few years and i am sure it's my **passion**.
I trying to learn something new everyday. I always wondering about writing my own blog.
There is a way to memorize somethings about what i learn but also what i am done and each
activity in programming. I am very opened mind to new things. If you read this little description
and maybe you want code something new, it's time to write to me.

I started coding with **Javascript** and **PHP**. Until today **PHP** is my main/root programming language.
But I am also training **JS** with **Node** and **Python** from 2020. I really love to training a lot!
Usually I participating in Coding Dojo Silesia coding events. It's great to coding with others and
after that talking about each code. Kata's are the best to practicing coding.

In other way I trying get some knowledge from books. One of the best books are from Uncle Bob and Gynvalel Coldwind.

I am also enroll to many programming events. I traveling through Poland to listen about newest features
and ideas. For example: PHPers Summit (Pozna≈Ñ), 4Developers (Warsaw), BoilingFrogs (Wroclaw) etc.

I also got some ideas to creating IoT project. I built my own air pollution sensor - [current sensor data](https://marcin.aqi.eco/en) 
according with [luftdaten](http://luftdaten.org.pl/) project.

My other plans are to contribute open source projects and join in hackathon.

And know i can describe myself from another side. I am really big fan of motorsports in each kind.
Formula one, rallying, racing - doesn't matter! I very often practicing on indoor and outdoor go karts.

But not only sitting behind computer screen! I love ot riding on bike, swimming and running (not to much but it's healthy)

Each year i doing some new things and visiting new places with my lovely girlfriend. And one more thing! - I love animals. My dog name is JSON :)
