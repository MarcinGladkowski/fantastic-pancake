Hello everyone! I coding a past few years and i am sure it's my **passion**.
I trying to learn something new everyday. I always wondering about writing my own blog.
There is a way to memorize somethings about what i learn but also what i am done and each
activity in programming. I am very opened mind to new things. If you read this little description
and maybe you want code something new, it's time to write to me.

I started coding with **Javascript** and **PHP**. Until today **PHP** is my main/root programming language.
But I am also training **JS** with **Node** and **Python** from 2020. I really love to training a lot!
Usually I participating in Coding Dojo Silesia coding events. It's great to coding with others and
after that talking about each code. Kata's are the best to practicing coding.

In other way I trying get some knowledge from books. One of the best books are from Uncle Bob and Gynvalel Coldwind.

I am also enroll to many programming events. I traveling through Poland to listen about newest features
and ideas. For example: PHPers Summit (Pozna≈Ñ), 4Developers (Warsaw), BoilingFrogs (Wroclaw) etc.

I also got some ideas to creating IoT project. I built my own air pollution sensor - [current sensor data](https://marcin.aqi.eco/en) 
according with [luftdaten](http://luftdaten.org.pl/) project.

My other plans are to contribute open source projects and join in hackathon.

Other hobbies ? Racing/rallying. I am amateur karting driver.
